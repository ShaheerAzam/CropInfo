            <h1>Fooders Crops</h1>
            <p1>FODDER CROPS are crops that are cultivated primarily for animal feed. By extension, natural grasslands and pastures are included whether they are cultivated or not.
                Fodder crops may be classified as either temporary or permanent crops. The former are cultivated and harvested like any other crop. Permanent fodder crops relate to land used permanently (for five years or more) for herbaceous forage crops, either cultivated or growing wild (i.e. wild prairie or grazing land), and may include some parts of forest land if it is used for grazing. 
                Temporary crops that are grown intensively with multiple cuttings per year include three major groups of fodder: grasses, including cereals that are harvested green; legumes, including pulses that are harvested green; and root crops that are cultivated for fodder. All three types are fed to animals, either as green feed, as hay, i.e. crops harvested dry or dried after harvesting, or as silage products. Silage, or ensilage, refers to green fodder preserved without drying by fermentation that retards spoiling. Some fodder crops are components of compound feeds.             
                Grasses contain crude fibres, crude protein and some minerals. Legumes are particularly rich in proteins and minerals. Root crops are high in starch and sugar and low in fibre, making them easy to digest. The fibre content of most fodder crops consists of cellulose, a complex carbohydrate polysaccharide that is indigestible for humans, but which is a good source of energy for animals, and particularly ruminants. </p1>

                <h1>Hay</h1>
                <p1>Hay is grass, legumes, or other herbaceous plants that have been cut and dried to be stored for use as animal fodder, particularly for large grazing animals raised as livestock, such as cattle, horses, goats, and sheep. However, it is also fed to smaller domesticated animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs. Pigs may also be fed hay, but they do not digest it as efficiently as herbivores.

                    Hay can be used as animal fodder when or where there is not enough pasture or rangeland on which to graze an animal, when grazing is not feasible due to weather (such as during the winter), or when lush pasture by itself would be too rich for the health of the animal. It is also fed when an animal is unable to access pasture, e.g. the animal is being kept in a stable or barn.
                    Commonly used plants for hay include mixtures of grasses such as ryegrass (Lolium species), timothy, brome, fescue, Bermuda grass, orchard grass, and other species, depending on region. Hay may also include legumes, such as alfalfa (lucerne) and clovers (red, white and subterranean).[1] Legumes in hay are ideally cut pre-bloom. Other pasture forbs are also sometimes a part of the mix, though these plants are not necessarily desired as certain forbs are toxic to some animals.

Oat, barley, and wheat plant materials are occasionally cut green and made into hay for animal fodder; however they are more usually used in the form of straw, a harvest byproduct where the stems and dead leaves are baled after the grain has been harvested and threshed. Straw is used mainly for animal bedding. Although straw is also used as fodder, particularly as a source of dietary fiber, it has lower nutritional value than hay.[1]

                <p1>Barley (Hordeum vulgare), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in temperate climates globally. It was one of the first cultivated grains, particularly in Eurasia as early as 10,000 years ago.[3] Barley has been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods. It is used in soups and stews, and in barley bread of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into malt in a traditional and ancient method of preparation.

                    In 2017, barley was ranked fourth among grains in quantity produced (149 million tonnes) behind maize, rice and wheat.[4]
                    Half of the United States' barley production is used as livestock feed.[69] Barley is an important feed grain in many areas of the world not typically suited for maize production, especially in northern climates—for example, northern and eastern Europe. Barley is the principal feed grain in Canada, Europe, and in the northern United States.[70] A finishing diet of barley is one of the defining characteristics of western Canadian beef used in marketing campaigns.[71]

As of 2014, an enzymatic process can be used to make a high-protein fish feed from barley, which is suitable for carnivorous fish such as trout and salmon.

                <h1>Alfalfa</h1>
                <p1>Alfalfa (/ælˈfælfə/) (Medicago sativa), also called lucerne, is a perennial flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is cultivated as an important forage crop in many countries around the world. It is used for grazing, hay, and silage, as well as a green manure and cover crop. The name alfalfa is used in North America. The name lucerne is the more commonly used name in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The plant superficially resembles clover (a cousin in the same family), especially while young, when trifoliate leaves comprising round leaflets predominate. Later in maturity, leaflets are elongated. It has clusters of small purple flowers followed by fruits spiralled in 2 to 3 turns containing 10–20 seeds. Alfalfa is native to warmer temperate climates. It has been cultivated as livestock fodder since at least the era of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Alfalfa sprouts are a common ingredient in dishes made in South Indian cuisine.[4]
                    When alfalfa is to be used as hay, it is usually cut and baled.[52] Loose haystacks are still used in some areas, but bales are easier for use in transportation, storage, and feed.[53] Ideally, the first cutting should be taken at the bud stage, and the subsequent cuttings just as the field is beginning to flower, or one-tenth bloom because carbohydrates are at their highest.[54] When using farm equipment rather than hand-harvesting, a swather cuts the alfalfa and arranges it in windrows.[55] In areas where the alfalfa does not immediately dry out on its own, a machine known as a mower-conditioner is used to cut the hay.[52] The mower-conditioner has a set of rollers or flails that crimp and break the stems as they pass through the mower, making the alfalfa dry faster.[56] After the alfalfa has dried, a tractor pulling a baler collects the hay into bales.

                <h1>Berseem</h1>
                <p1>
                    Berseem (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) is one of the most important leguminous forages in the Mediterranean region and in the Middle-East. Berseem is an annual, sparsely hairy, erect forage legume, 30 to 80 cm high (Hackney et al., 2007; Hannaway et al., 2004; Suttie, 1999). Berseem has a shallow taproot. Its stems are hollow, branching at the base, with alternate leaves bearing 4-5 cm long x 2-3 cm broad leaflets. Flowers are yellowish-white and form dense, elliptical clustered heads about 2 cm in diameter. The flowers must be cross-pollinated by honey bees to produce seeds. The fruit is a pod containing one single white to purplish-red seed (Smoliak et al., 2006). Berseem is a variable species that can be classified into four cultivars groups according to their branching behaviour and subsequent productivity. Highly branching and productive types are Miscawi and Kahdrawi (Hannaway et al., 2004; Suttie, 1999).

Berseem is a fast growing, high quality forage that is mainly cut and fed as green chopped forage. It is often compared to alfalfa, due to its comparable feed value. However, unlike alfalfa, it has never been reported to cause bloat. It is slightly less drought-resistant but does better on high moisture and alkalinic soils. Moreover, berseem can be sown in early autumn and can thus provide feed before and during the colder months (Suttie, 1999). It is very productive when temperatures rise after winter (Hannaway et al., 2004; Suttie, 1999). The seeds are abundant under favourable conditions. Berseem can also be made into silage with oats or be fed chaffed and mixed with chopped straw (Hannaway et al., 2004; Suttie, 1999). Grazing is possible though less common than cutting. Berseem clover can also be used as green manure crop (Hannaway et al., 2004).
